# MandelZoom
A demo program by Don Cross that creates video zooms into the Mandelbrot Set.

Uses the files `lodepng.cpp` and `lodepng.h` from
Lode Vandevenne's [LodePNG image encoder/decoder](https://github.com/lvandeve/lodepng)
to write PNG files.

The host computer must have [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) installed to convert the resulting
PNG files into an MP4 movie.
